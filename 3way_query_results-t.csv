Wikipedia,10,networkx,1,"Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung, where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. It is usually unilateral and is often called a collapsed lung. It is not synonymous with a pneumothorax and may occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. It can lead to infant respiratory distress syndrome and is caused by various medical conditions, including post-op fever."
,,,2,"Symptoms of Atelectasis include shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing, and difficulty breathing."
,,,3,"Atelectasis can be caused by normal exhalation, various medical conditions, and as a result of surfactant deficiency. It can also be a post-operative complication or lead to infant respiratory distress syndrome."
,,,4,"Radiologists need to look for signs of collapse or closure of a lung, usually unilateral, with the alveoli deflated down to little or no volume. They should also be aware of the various medical conditions that can cause Atelectasis, as well as post-operative complications and surfactant deficiency. Additionally, they should look for signs of infant respiratory distress syndrome and post-op fever."
,,,5,"Radiographic features of Atelectasis include decreased lung volume, increased density of the affected area, and air bronchograms"
,,Neo4jVectorIndex,1,"Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is governed by English law."
,,,2,"The symptoms of Atelectasis may include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. However, it is a common misconception that atelectasis causes fever. There is no clinical evidence supporting this speculation. Atelectasis is often a common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies and may be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. The most common cause of atelectasis is post-surgical atelectasis, which develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure. Other causes include pulmonary tuberculosis, smoking, and age-related factors. The diagnosis of atelectasis is generally visible on chest X-ray, and treatment depends on the underlying cause."
,,,3,"Atelectasis can be caused by normal exhalation or by various medical conditions such as post-operative complications, surfactant deficiency, and infant respiratory distress syndrome. It can also be caused by factors such as bronchial obstruction, poor surfactant spreading, and suction."
,,,4,"For diagnosing Atelectasis, radiologists need to look for signs such as lung opacification, loss of lung volume, displacement of interlobar fissures, and mobile structures within the thorax. These features are generally visible on a chest X-ray. Additionally, clinical symptoms such as cough, chest pain, breathing difficulty, low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion, cyanosis, and increased heart rate may also be present. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be necessary if the cause of atelectasis is not clinically apparent. "
,,,5,"Radiographic features of atelectasis include the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange, unilateral involvement of part or all of one lung, and deflation of the alveoli. It is often seen in chest X-rays and other radiological studies. Atelectasis is not synonymous with pneumothorax, although it can cause atelectasis. It can be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. Acute atelectasis may occur as a post-operative complication or due to surfactant deficiency. In premature babies, it can lead to infant respiratory distress syndrome."
,,Neo4jGraph,1,"Atelectasis is a condition where part or all of one lung collapses or closes, resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It can be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. The alveoli, which are small air sacs in the lungs, become deflated down to little or no volume. Atelectasis is also known as a collapsed lung."

Radiopaedia,20,networkx,1,"Atelectasis is a condition in which small areas of the lung collapse due to adjacent compression, passive atelectasis, or dependent atelectasis. It is usually seen on chest x-rays as small volume linear shadows and CT is often helpful to determine the cause or confirm that there is no proximal obstruction."

,,,5,Atelectasis is usually seen on chest x-rays as small volume linear shadows.
,,Neo4jVectorIndex,1,"Atelectasis refers to collapse or incomplete expansion of pulmonary parenchyma. It can be classified based on underlying mechanism (resorptive, passive, compressive, cicatrisation, adhesive, gravity dependent) or by morphology (linear, round, lung, lobar, segmental, subsegmental). The radiographic features of atelectasis vary depending on the underlying mechanism and type. It is better appreciated on CT scans. Segmental atelectasis specifically refers to the collapse of one or several segments of a lung lobe."
,,,2,"The symptoms of Atelectasis can vary depending on the underlying cause. Common symptoms include breathlessness and cough, but it can also be asymptomatic. The presentation of symptoms also depends on the extent and speed of development of atelectasis. Physical examination may reveal diminished movement of the affected area, dullness on percussion, decreased or absent breath sounds, and deviation of the trachea. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause and may include deeper breathing exercises. Imaging, such as chest x-ray or CT, can confirm the presence of atelectasis and help determine the cause."
,,,3,"Atelectasis can be caused by various factors, including adjacent compression (such as a lung tumor or dilated aorta), passive atelectasis (when the lung relaxes away from the pleural surface), dependent atelectasis (due to patients not fully expanding their lungs while lying for long periods), and adhesive atelectasis (due to a decrease or absence of pulmonary surfactant). Other causes include simple pneumothorax, diaphragmatic abnormalities, conditions of hypoventilation, pleural effusion, and chest wall mass lesions. Cicatrisation atelectasis can occur as a result of scarring or fibrosis."
,,,4,"Radiologists need to look for the following clinical features for diagnosing Atelectasis:\n- Small volume linear shadows on chest x-rays, usually peripherally or at the lung bases.\n- Triangular opacity in the posteromedial aspect of the left lung (retrocardiac sail sign) for left lower lobe collapse.\n- Linear bands radiating from a mass into adjacent lung tissue resembling the feet of a crow for round atelectasis.\n- Loss of negative intrapleural pressure leading to relaxation of the lung and possible hypoxia and respiratory failure for passive atelectasis."
,,,5,"Radiographic features of atelectasis include small volume linear shadows on chest x-rays, usually peripherally or at the lung bases. CT scans can provide a more accurate depiction of the involved lung and can help determine the cause of atelectasis. Other radiographic features may include displacement of interlobar fissures, crowding of pulmonary vessels and bronchi, and compensatory hyperexpansion of the surrounding or contralateral lung. Linear atelectasis, also known as Fleischner lines, may appear as thin, linear densities in the lung bases parallel to the diaphragm. Segmental atelectasis refers to the collapse of one or several segments of a lung lobe. The crow feet sign is a characteristic feature seen in round atelectasis on CT scans, appearing as linear bands radiating from a mass into adjacent lung tissue."
