      "Atelectasis refers to collapse or incomplete expansion of pulmonary parenchyma. It can be caused by various factors, including resorptive (obstructive) atelectasis, passive (relaxation) atelectasis, compressive atelectasis, cicatrisation atelectasis, adhesive atelectasis, and gravity-dependent atelectasis. Passive atelectasis, also known as relaxation atelectasis, occurs when there is a loss of negative pressure in the pleural space, causing the lung to relax back to its normal volume. It can be caused by conditions such as simple pneumothorax, diaphragmatic abnormalities, and conditions of hypoventilation. The clinical presentation of atelectasis depends on the extent and speed of development, ranging from asymptomatic to features of hypoxia and respiratory failure. Radiographic features of atelectasis include small volume linear shadows on chest x-rays and a more accurate depiction on CT scans.\n",
      "The symptoms associated with Atelectasis include breathlessness, cough, and chest pain. However, it is important to note that the specific symptoms can vary depending on the underlying cause of the atelectasis.\n",
      "Atelectasis can be caused by various factors, including hypoventilation, postoperative status, chest wall trauma, pleuritic chest disease, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, aspiration, and bronchogenic carcinoma. Linear atelectasis, also known as discoid, plate, or band atelectasis, is a focal area of subsegmental atelectasis that has a linear shape. It is commonly seen in the lung bases and can resolve quickly. Linear atelectasis is often a result of subsegmental bronchial obstruction.\n",
      "The relevant symptoms for Atelectasis include breathlessness and cough. However, the specific symptoms of the patient in question are not provided in the extracted parts of the document.\n",
      "The relevant clinical signs for the etiological diagnosis of Atelectasis include diminished movement of the affected area, dullness on percussion, decreased or absent breath sounds, and deviation of the trachea to the affected site. However, the clinical presentation may vary depending on the extent and speed of development of atelectasis. Small and gradual areas of atelectasis may be asymptomatic or present with a non-productive cough, while larger and more rapidly developing areas can lead to hypoxia and respiratory failure.\n",
      "The relevant laboratory data for the etiological diagnosis of Atelectasis are not provided in the extracted parts of the document.\n",
      "The relevant clinical characteristics for the etiological diagnosis of Atelectasis include hypoventilatory change in patients who are not taking deep breaths, postoperative status, chest wall trauma, pleuritic chest disease, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, aspiration, and bronchogenic carcinoma. Linear atelectasis is a common form of atelectasis that appears primarily in the lung bases and is secondary to hypoventilation. It can resolve as quickly as it occurs. Linear atelectasis is also known as plate, discoid, or band atelectasis. It is characterized by a focal area of subsegmental atelectasis that has a linear shape. It may appear to be horizontal, oblique, or perpendicular. Linear atelectasis is usually caused by subsegmental bronchial obstruction.
