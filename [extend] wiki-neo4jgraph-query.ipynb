This condition is often referred to as a collapsed lung, although it usually involves only a partial collapse. Atelectasis is a common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies. It can be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. It is important to note that atelectasis is not synonymous with a pneumothorax, which is a more specific condition that can cause atelectasis.\n",
