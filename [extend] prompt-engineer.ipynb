    "Question: What are the symptoms associated with atelectasis?\n",
    "Answer: The symptoms associated with atelectasis may include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. However, atelectasis can also be asymptomatic. Fever is not a symptom of atelectasis.\n",
    "Question: What can cause atelectasis?\n",
    "Answer: Atelectasis can be caused by various medical conditions, including post-surgical complications, surfactant deficiency, and poor surfactant spreading during inspiration. It can also be caused by blockage of a bronchiole or bronchus, such as by a foreign body, mucus plug, tumor, or compression from the outside. Risk factors for atelectasis include certain types of surgery, muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, lower lung segments, age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic.\n",
    "Question: What are the patient’s symptoms that are relevant for atelectasis?\n",
    "Answer: The relevant symptoms for atelectasis include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate.\n",
    "Question: What are the relevant clinical signs for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis?\n",
    "Answer: The relevant clinical signs for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis may include cough, chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. However, it is important to note that atelectasis can also be asymptomatic.\n",
    "Question: What are the relevant laboratory data for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis?\n",
    "Answer: The relevant laboratory data for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis are not provided in the given information.\n",
    "Question: What are the relevant clinical characteristics for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis\n",
    "Answer: The relevant clinical characteristics for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. It is important to note that atelectasis does not cause fever. The incidence of fever actually decreases as the incidence of atelectasis increases. There is no clinical evidence supporting the speculation that atelectasis causes fever.\n",
    "Question: What are the patient’s personal relevant history for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis\n",
    "Answer: The patient's personal relevant history for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis includes post-surgical atelectasis as a common cause, as well as pulmonary tuberculosis, smoking, and old age as risk factors. Other factors associated with the development of atelectasis include the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and the type of anesthesia used. The diagnosis of atelectasis is generally confirmed through chest X-ray, which shows small volume linear shadows, usually peripherally or at the lung bases. CT chest or bronchoscopy may be necessary to determine the cause or confirm the absence of proximal obstruction.\n",

There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
