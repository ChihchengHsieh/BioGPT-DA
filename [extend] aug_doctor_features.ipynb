    "    \"What are the symptoms associated with pulmonary edema?\": \"The symptoms associated with pulmonary edema include dyspnea (shortness of breath), hypoxemia (low oxygen levels), and respiratory failure. Other symptoms may include coughing, wheezing, frothy sputum, and chest pain. Diagnostic tests such as CBC, troponin, BNP, chest x-ray, CT scan, and ultrasound are used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. Treatment focuses on improving respiratory function, treating the underlying cause, and preventing further damage. Pulmonary edema can cause permanent organ damage and can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.\",\n",
    "    \"What can cause pulmonary edema?\": \"Pulmonary edema can be caused by multiple factors, including cardiogenic causes (such as congestive heart failure, pericardial tamponade, heart valve dysfunction, and hypertensive crisis) and noncardiogenic causes (related to increased microvascular permeability). Various laboratory tests and imaging studies are used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. Treatment focuses on improving respiratory function, treating the underlying cause, and preventing further damage. Pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest if not treated promptly.\",\n",
