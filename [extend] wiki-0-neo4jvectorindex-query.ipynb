       "{'answer': 'Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to pneumothorax. It is a very common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies, and may be caused by normal exhalation or by various medical conditions. The most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, characterized by restricted breathing after abdominal surgery. Other causes include pulmonary tuberculosis, blockage of a bronchiole or bronchus, poor surfactant spreading during inspiration, and relaxation atelectasis. Diagnosis is generally done through chest X-ray, and additional tests such as CT scan or bronchoscopy may be necessary. \\n',\n",
