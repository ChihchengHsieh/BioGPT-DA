Other symptoms may include coughing, wheezing, frothy sputum, and chest pain. Diagnostic tests such as CBC, troponin, BNP, chest x-ray, CT scan, and ultrasound are used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. Treatment focuses on improving respiratory function, treating the underlying cause, and preventing further damage. Pulmonary edema can cause permanent organ damage and can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.\",\n",

Various laboratory tests and imaging studies are used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. Treatment focuses on improving respiratory function, treating the underlying cause, and preventing further damage. Pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest if not treated promptly.\",\n",

TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs  COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs most recent on .  FINDINGS:   Compared with the previous examination there is increased diffuse interstitial opacities with a linear consolidation in the right lower lung compatible with atelectasis. There is also a focal opacity in the left for lower lung and retrocardiac region with associated small pleural effusion better seen in the lateral view.  Calcified granulomas are redemonstrated more prominently in the left apex. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Rightward deviation of the trachea is also unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  IMPRESSION:   Patchy opacities in the left lower lung and retrocardiac region may represent left lower lobe pneumonia on the background of interstitial pulmonary edema. LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouette Atelectasis. AGE: 93. GENDER: Male. \n",
