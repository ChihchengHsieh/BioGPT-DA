It is typically caused by a blockage of the tiny airways (bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Atelectasis can lead to decreased oxygen levels in the blood, which can be serious if not treated promptly. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, cough, and chest pain.',\n",

Compression: Conditions such as pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or a large tumor can compress the lung and cause atelectasis.\\n3. Postoperative: This is common after surgery, especially in the upper abdomen or chest. General anesthesia changes your regular pattern of breathing and affects the exchange of lung gases, which can lead to atelectasis.\\n4. Lung Diseases: Certain lung diseases like pneumonia or lung cancer can cause atelectasis.\\n5. Prolonged Bed Rest: Being in a horizontal position for extended periods can cause mucus to accumulate in the lungs, leading to atelectasis.\\n6. Neuromuscular Disorders: Conditions that affect the muscles needed for breathing, such as muscular dystrophy or myasthenia gravis, can lead to atelectasis.\\n7. Chest Injuries: Any injury that causes pain while breathing can lead to atelectasis.\\n8. Smoking: Chronic smoking can cause damage to the airways leading to atelectasis.',\n",

Dyspnea: Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing is a common symptom of atelectasis.\\n\\n3. Tachypnea: Rapid breathing may occur as the body tries to compensate for the reduced lung capacity.\\n\\n4. Cyanosis: This is a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to low oxygen levels.\\n\\n5.
