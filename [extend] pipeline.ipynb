There is no clinical evidence supporting the speculation that atelectasis causes fever.\n",
      "Question: What are the patient’s personal relevant history for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis\n",
      "Answer: The patient's personal relevant history for the etiological diagnosis of atelectasis includes post-surgical atelectasis as a common cause, as well as pulmonary tuberculosis, smoking, and old age as risk factors. Other factors associated with the development of atelectasis include the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and the type of anesthesia used. The diagnosis of atelectasis is generally confirmed through chest X-ray, which shows small volume linear shadows, usually peripherally or at the lung bases. CT chest or bronchoscopy may be necessary to determine the cause or confirm the absence of proximal obstruction.\n",

      "INDICATION:  Central venous line placement.  TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.  COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph 12:42 today.  FINDINGS:   A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheter terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava and if indicated could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within the low SVC.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the left abdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcifications left greater than right. LESIONS: Enlarged cardiac silhouett. AGE: 69. GENDER: Female.\n",
