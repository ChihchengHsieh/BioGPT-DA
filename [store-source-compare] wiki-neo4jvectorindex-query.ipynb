      "Atelectasis is the partial collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. It is often referred to informally as a collapsed lung, although more accurately it usually involves only a partial collapse. The term uses combining forms of atel- + ectasis, from Greek: ἀτελής, \"incomplete\" + ἔκτασις, \"extension\". It is a very common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies, and may be caused by normal exhalation or by various medical conditions. Although frequently described as a collapse of lung tissue, atelectasis is not synonymous with a pneumothorax, which is a more specific condition that can cause atelectasis. Acute atelectasis may occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. In premature babies, this leads to infant respiratory distress syndrome. (\n",
      "The symptoms associated with Atelectasis may include cough, chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. However, it is important to note that atelectasis does not cause fever. The association between atelectasis and post-op fever is not supported by clinical evidence. Atelectasis can be diagnosed through chest X-rays, which may show lung opacification and/or loss of lung volume. The most common cause of atelectasis is post-surgical atelectasis, which develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure. Other causes include pulmonary tuberculosis, blockage of a bronchiole or bronchus, poor surfactant spreading during inspiration, and relaxation atelectasis. Risk factors for atelectasis include type of surgery, use of muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, lower lung segments, age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic. Treatment for atelectasis involves treating the underlying cause.\n",
      "Atelectasis can be caused by various factors, including normal exhalation, medical conditions, post-operative complications, surfactant deficiency, bronchial obstruction, tumor, mucus plug, poor surfactant spreading, suction, and more. Prematurity, lack of surfactant, and respiratory distress syndrome can also contribute to atelectasis in newborns. Other risk factors include type of surgery, muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, lower lung segments, age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and type of anesthetic.\n",
      "The symptoms that are relevant for Atelectasis include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. Fever is not a symptom of atelectasis.\n",
      "The relevant clinical signs for the etiological diagnosis of Atelectasis include cough, chest pain, breathing difficulty, low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion, cyanosis, and increased heart rate. However, it is important to note that atelectasis does not cause fever. The most common cause of atelectasis is post-surgical atelectasis, but it can also be caused by pulmonary tuberculosis, smoking, and other factors. Diagnosis of atelectasis is generally done through chest X-ray, which can show lung opacification and/or loss of lung volume. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of atelectasis.\n",
