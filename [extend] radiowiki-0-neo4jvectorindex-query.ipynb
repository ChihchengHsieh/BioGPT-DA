      "Atelectasis is the partial collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. It is often referred to informally as a collapsed lung, although more accurately it usually involves only a partial collapse. It can be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. It is a common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies. The most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, but it can also be caused by pulmonary tuberculosis, smoking, and other factors. The diagnosis of atelectasis is generally visible on chest X-ray, and treatment involves managing the underlying cause.\n",
      "The symptoms associated with Atelectasis may include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. However, it is important to note that Atelectasis can also be asymptomatic.\n",
      "Atelectasis can be caused by various factors, including post-surgical complications, surfactant deficiency, pulmonary tuberculosis, blockage of the airway, and poor surfactant spreading during inspiration. Other risk factors include certain types of surgery, muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, lower lung segments, age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic.\n",

It is important to note that fever is not a clinical characteristic of atelectasis. The most common cause of atelectasis is post-surgical atelectasis, which develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure. Other causes include pulmonary tuberculosis, smoking, and age. Diagnosis of atelectasis is generally visible on chest X-ray, which shows small volume linear shadows, usually peripherally or at the lung bases. CT chest or bronchoscopy may be necessary to determine the cause or confirm the absence of proximal obstruction. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause and promoting deeper breathing if the cause is due to hypoventilation.\n",
      "The patient's personal relevant history for the etiological diagnosis of Atelectasis includes post-surgical atelectasis as a common cause, as well as pulmonary tuberculosis, smoking, and being elderly as additional risk factors. Other factors associated with the development of atelectasis include age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic. The condition can also be caused by adjacent compression, passive atelectasis, dependent atelectasis, and poor surfactant spreading during inspiration.\n"
