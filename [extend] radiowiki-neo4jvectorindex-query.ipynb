       "{'answer': 'Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. It can be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. Atelectasis is not synonymous with a pneumothorax, although a pneumothorax can cause atelectasis. It can occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. It is a common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies. The most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, which develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure. Other causes include pulmonary tuberculosis, obstruction of the airway, poor surfactant spreading, and compression of the lung by a space-occupying lesion. Clinically significant atelectasis is generally visible on chest X-ray and may require further imaging or bronchoscopy for diagnosis. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause.

They can also use CT scans to accurately depict the involved lung and determine the cause. Additionally, the presence of the crow feet sign, which appears as linear bands radiating from a mass into adjacent lung tissue, can be a characteristic feature of round atelectasis. The clinical presentation of atelectasis can vary depending on the extent and speed of development, but common symptoms include breathlessness, cough, and diminished breath sounds.
