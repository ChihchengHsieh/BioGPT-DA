      "Atelectasis is the partial collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. The term \"atelectasis\" is used to describe small areas of collapsed lung, and it is often seen on chest X-rays. The underlying cause of atelectasis can vary, including post-surgical complications, surfactant deficiency, or obstructive factors such as tumors or mucus plugs. The diagnosis of atelectasis is typically confirmed through imaging, such as chest X-rays or CT scans. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause and promoting deeper breathing.\n",
      "The symptoms associated with atelectasis may include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. It is important to note that atelectasis does not cause fever.\n",
      "Passive atelectasis can be caused by conditions such as simple pneumothorax, diaphragmatic abnormalities, and conditions of hypoventilation such as pleural effusion or chest wall mass lesions.\n",

The causes of atelectasis can include post-surgical complications, surfactant deficiency, obstructing neoplasms, mucus plugging, and foreign body aspiration, among others. Risk factors associated with atelectasis include type of surgery, use of muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, lower lung segments, age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic. Diagnosis of atelectasis is generally visible on chest X-ray, and additional imaging such as CT or bronchoscopy may be necessary to determine the cause.\n",
      "The patient's personal relevant history for the etiological diagnosis of Atelectasis includes conditions such as pleural effusion, pneumothorax, diaphragmatic abnormalities (such as diaphragmatic hernia or paralysis), and chest wall mass lesions. These conditions can lead to passive atelectasis, which is a form of lung atelectasis caused by the loss of negative pressure in the pleural space. Other causes of atelectasis include obstructive atelectasis and compressive atelectasis. The clinical presentation of atelectasis can vary depending on the extent and speed of development, but common symptoms include cough, hypoxia, and respiratory failure.

It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. It can be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. Atelectasis is not synonymous with a pneumothorax, although a pneumothorax can cause atelectasis. It can occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. It is a common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies. The most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, which develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure. Other causes include pulmonary tuberculosis, obstruction of the airway, poor surfactant spreading, and compression of the lung by a space-occupying lesion. Clinically significant atelectasis is generally visible on chest X-ray and may require further imaging or bronchoscopy for diagnosis. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause.
