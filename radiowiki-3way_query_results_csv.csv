Wikipedi & Radiopaedia,10(wiki)+20(radiopaedia),networkx,1,"Atelectasis is a condition in which small areas of the lung collapse due to adjacent compression, passive atelectasis, or dependent atelectasis. It is usually seen on chest x-rays as small volume linear shadows and CT is often helpful to determine the cause or confirm that there is no proximal obstruction."
,,,2,"Atelectasis is usually asymptomatic, but some people may experience shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing."
,,,3,"Atelectasis can be caused by adjacent compression, passive atelectasis, and dependent atelectasis."
,,,4,"Radiologists need to look for small areas of collapsed lung, small volume linear shadows, and adjacent compression on chest x-rays to diagnose Atelectasis. CT scans may also be helpful to determine the cause or confirm that there is no proximal obstruction."

,,Neo4jVectorIndex,1,"Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. It can be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. Atelectasis is not synonymous with a pneumothorax, although a pneumothorax can cause atelectasis. It can occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. It is a common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies. The most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, which develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure. Other causes include pulmonary tuberculosis, obstruction of the airway, poor surfactant spreading, and compression of the lung by a space-occupying lesion. Clinically significant atelectasis is generally visible on chest X-ray and may require further imaging or bronchoscopy for diagnosis. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause"
,,,2,"The symptoms of Atelectasis may include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. However, it is important to note that atelectasis can also be asymptomatic."
,,,3,"Atelectasis can be caused by various factors, including post-surgical complications, surfactant deficiency, pulmonary tuberculosis, blockage of the airway, compression from external factors, poor surfactant spreading, and certain risk factors such as type of surgery, obesity, high oxygen, and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. It can also occur due to passive atelectasis or adhesive atelectasis."
,,,4,"Radiologists need to look for small volume linear shadows on chest x-rays, usually peripherally or at the lung bases, to diagnose atelectasis. They can also use CT scans to accurately depict the involved lung and determine the cause. Additionally, the presence of the crow feet sign, which appears as linear bands radiating from a mass into adjacent lung tissue, can be a characteristic feature of round atelectasis. The clinical presentation of atelectasis can vary depending on the extent and speed of development, but common symptoms include breathlessness, cough, and diminished breath sounds. The underlying causes of atelectasis can include adjacent compression, passive atelectasis, and dependent atelectasis. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause and promoting deeper breathing if hypoventilation is the cause."
,,,5,"Radiographic features of atelectasis include small volume linear shadows on chest x-rays, usually peripherally or at the lung bases. The underlying cause may also be visible. CT chest allows for a more accurate depiction of the involved lung and can help determine the cause. Round atelectasis can be seen on CT as linear bands radiating from a mass into adjacent lung tissue, resembling the feet of a crow. Atelectasis can also be classified based on underlying mechanism (resorptive, passive, compressive, cicatrisation, adhesive, gravity dependent) or morphology (linear, round, lung, lobar, segmental, subsegmental). The radiographic features vary depending on the type and mechanism of atelectasis."
,,Neo4jGraph,1,"Atelectasis is a condition where part or all of one lung collapses or closes, resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It can be caused by normal exhalation or various medical conditions. The alveoli, which are small air sacs in the lungs, become deflated down to little or no volume. Atelectasis is also known as a collapsed lung."
,,,2,"I'm sorry, but I don't have the information to answer your question. It would be best to consult a medical professional for accurate information on the symptoms of Atelectasis."
,,,3,"There are several factors that can cause atelectasis. Some common causes include blockage of the airways due to mucus, a foreign object, or a tumor, as well as lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia. Additionally, certain medical procedures, such as anesthesia or prolonged bed rest, can also contribute to the development of atelectasis. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."
,,,4,"To diagnose Atelectasis, radiologists typically look for certain clinical features. These may include signs such as lung collapse, airway obstruction, and reduced lung volume. Additionally, they may also consider the presence of symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, and chest pain. By evaluating these clinical features, radiologists can make an accurate diagnosis of Atelectasis."
