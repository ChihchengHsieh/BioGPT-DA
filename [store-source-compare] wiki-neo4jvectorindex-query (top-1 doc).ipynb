      "Atelectasis is the partial collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume. It is often referred to informally as a collapsed lung, although more accurately it usually involves only a partial collapse. It is a very common finding in chest X-rays and other radiological studies, and may be caused by normal exhalation or by various medical conditions. Acute atelectasis may occur as a post-operative complication or as a result of surfactant deficiency. In premature babies, this leads to infant respiratory distress syndrome. The most common cause is post-surgical atelectasis, characterized by restricted breathing after abdominal surgery. Other causes include pulmonary tuberculosis, blockage of a bronchiole or bronchus, poor surfactant spreading during inspiration, and relaxation atelectasis. Diagnosis is generally visible on chest X-ray.\n",
      "The symptoms associated with Atelectasis may include cough (not prominent), chest pain (not common), breathing difficulty (fast and shallow), low oxygen saturation, pleural effusion (transudate type), cyanosis (late sign), and increased heart rate. It is important to note that fever is not a symptom of atelectasis.\n",
      "Atelectasis can be caused by various factors, including post-surgical complications, pulmonary tuberculosis, blockage of the airway, poor surfactant spreading, and relaxation atelectasis. Other risk factors associated with atelectasis include certain types of surgery, use of muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen levels, lower lung segments, age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic.
