However, atelectasis can also be asymptomatic. Fever is not a symptom of atelectasis.\",\n",
    "    \"What can cause atelectasis?\": \"Atelectasis can be caused by various medical conditions, including post-surgical complications, surfactant deficiency, and poor surfactant spreading during inspiration. It can also be caused by blockage of a bronchiole or bronchus, such as by a foreign body, mucus plug, tumor, or compression from the outside. Risk factors for atelectasis include certain types of surgery, muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, lower lung segments, age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and type of anesthetic.\",\n",

It is important to note that atelectasis does not cause fever. The underlying causes of atelectasis can include adjacent compression, passive atelectasis, dependent atelectasis, and poor surfactant spreading. Risk factors for atelectasis include type of surgery, use of muscle relaxation, obesity, high oxygen, lower lung segments, age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and type of anesthetic. Diagnosis of atelectasis is generally confirmed through chest X-ray, which may show lung opacification and/or loss of lung volume. Additional imaging modalities such as CT chest or bronchoscopy may be necessary to determine the cause of atelectasis.\",\n",

Other factors associated with the development of atelectasis include the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and the type of anesthesia used. The diagnosis of atelectasis is generally confirmed through chest X-ray, which shows small volume linear shadows, usually peripherally or at the lung bases. CT chest or bronchoscopy may be necessary to determine the cause or confirm the absence of proximal obstruction.\",\n",

There is also a focal opacity in the left for lower lung and retrocardiac region with associated small pleural effusion better seen in the lateral view.  Calcified granulomas are redemonstrated more prominently in the left apex. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Rightward deviation of the trachea is also unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.
