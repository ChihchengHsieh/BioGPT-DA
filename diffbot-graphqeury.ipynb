It leads to impaired gas exchange and may cause hypoxemia and respiratory failure. It is due to either failure of the left ventricle of the heart to remove oxygenated blood adequately from the pulmonary circulation (cardiogenic pulmonary edema), or an injury to the lung tissue directly or blood vessels of the lung (non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema).Treatment is focused on three aspects: firstly improving respiratory function, secondly, treating the underlying cause, and thirdly preventing further damage and assuring full recovery to the lung. Pulmonary edema, especially when sudden (acute), can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest due to hypoxia. It is a cardinal feature of congestive heart failure. The term edema is from the Greek οἴδημα (oidēma, \"swelling\"), from οἰδέω (oidéō, \"(I) swell\").\\n\\n\\n== Types ==\\nClassically it is cardiogenic (left ventricular) but fluid may also accumulate due to damage to the lung. This damage may be from direct external injuries or injuries mediated by high pressures within the pulmonary circulation. When directly or indirectly caused by increased left ventricular pressure, pulmonary edema may form when mean pulmonary pressure rises from the normal average of 15 mmHg to above 25 mmHg, where pulmonary fluid may form. Broadly, the causes of pulmonary edema can be divided into cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. By convention, cardiogenic specifically refers to left ventricular causes.\\n\\n\\n=== Cardiogenic ===\\nCongestive heart failure which is due to the heart\\'s inability to pump the blood out of the pulmonary circulation at a sufficient rate resulting in elevation in pulmonary wedge pressure and edema – this usually is due to left ventricular failure, but may also be from arrhythmias, or fluid overload, (e.g. from kidney failure or intravenous therapy).\\nHypertensive crisis can cause pulmonary edema as the elevation in blood pressure and increased afterload on the left ventricle hinders forward flow in blood vessels and causes the elevation in wedge pressure and subsequent pulmonary edema.\\n\\n\\n=== Non-cardiogenic ===\\nNegative pressure pulmonary edema in which a significant negative (internal) pressure in the chest (such as from an inhalation against an upper airway obstruction) ruptures capillaries and floods the alveoli with blood. Negative pressure pulmonary edema has an incidence in the range of 0.05-0.1% in cases of general anesthesia. The negative pressure causes a significant increase in preload, thereby increasing pulmonary blood volume.  There is also a significant increase in left ventricular afterload, which causes a decreased cardiac output.  The increase in pulmonary blood volume and pressure along with a decrease in cardiac output to the lungs will increase the pulmonary transudative pressures and the risk of pulmonary edema. With all this occurring, pulmonary vascular resistance increases causing a shift of the intraventricular septum.  The ventricular septal shift to the left causes a left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which further increases pulmonary hydrostatic pressures and the risk.\\nNeurogenic causes  (seizures, head trauma, strangulation, electrocution).\\nPulmonary embolismAcute lung injury may also cause pulmonary edema directly through injury to the vasculature and parenchyma of the lung. It includes acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. (ALI-ARDS) cover many of these causes, but they may also include:\\n\\nInhalation of hot or toxic gases\\nPulmonary contusion, i.e., high-energy trauma (e.g. vehicle accidents)\\nAspiration, e.g., gastric fluid\\nReexpansion, i.e. post large volume thoracocentesis, resolution of pneumothorax, post decortication, removal of endobronchial obstruction, effectively a form of negative pressure pulmonary oedema.\\nReperfusion injury, i.e., postpulmonary thromboendartectomy or lung transplantat', metadata={'title': 'Pulmonary edema', 'summary': 'Pulmonary edema, also known as pulmonary congestion, is excessive liquid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces (usually alveoli) of the lungs.

The most reliable sign of HAPE is severe fatigue or exercise intolerance, especially in a climber that was previously not displaying this symptom.\\n\\n\\n== Risk factors ==\\nThere are multiple factors that can contribute to the development of HAPE, including sex (male), genetic factors, prior development of HAPE, ascent rate, cold exposure, peak altitude, intensity of physical exertion, and certain underlying medical conditions (e.g., pulmonary hypertension). Anatomic abnormalities that are predisposing include congenital absence of pulmonary artery, and left-to-right intracardiac shunts (e.g., atrial and ventricular septal defects), both of which increase pulmonary blood flow. HAPE-susceptible (HAPE-s) individuals were also found to be four times more likely to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) than those who were HAPE-resistant. There is currently no indication or recommendation for people with PFO to pursue closure prior to extreme altitude exposure.In studies performed at sea level, HAPE-s people were found to have exaggerated circulatory response to both hypoxia at rest and during exercise. In these individuals, the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were shown to be abnormally high. Microneurographic recordings in these individuals developed a direct link between PAP rise and sympathetic nervous system over-activation, which could explain the exaggerated response to hypoxia in these persons.Endothelial tissue dysfunction has also been linked to development of HAPE, including reduced synthesis of NO (a potent vasodilator), increased levels of endothelin (a potent vasconstrictor), and an impaired ability to transport sodium and water across the epithelium and out of the alveoli.Data on the genetic basis for HAPE susceptibility is conflicting and interpretation is difficult. Genes implicated in the development of HAPE include those in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), NO pathway, and hypoxia-inducible factor pathway (HIF).

Certain organs develop edema through tissue specific mechanisms. Examples of edema in specific organs:\\n\\nPeripheral edema (“dependent” edema of legs) is extracellular fluid accumulation in the lower extremities caused by the effects of gravity, and occurs when fluid pools in the lower parts of the body, including the feet, legs, or hands.  This often occurs in immobile patients, such as paraplegics or quadriplegics, pregnant women, or in otherwise healthy people due to hypervolemia or maintaining a standing or seated posture for an extended period of time. It can occur due to diminished venous return of blood to the heart due to congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. It can also occur in patients with increased hydrostatic venous pressure or decreased oncotic venous pressure, due to obstruction of lymphatic or venous vessels draining the lower extremity. Certain drugs (for example, amlodipine) can cause pedal edema.\\nCerebral edema is extracellular fluid accumulation in the brain. It can occur in toxic or abnormal metabolic states and conditions such as systemic lupus or reduced oxygen at high altitudes. It causes drowsiness or loss of consciousness, leading to brain herniation and death.\\nPulmonary edema occurs when the pressure in blood vessels in the lung is raised because of obstruction to the removal of blood via the pulmonary veins. This is usually due to failure of the left ventricle of the heart. It can also occur in altitude sickness or on inhalation of toxic chemicals. Pulmonary edema produces shortness of breath. Pleural effusions may occur when fluid also accumulates in the pleural cavity.\\nEdema may also be found in the cornea of the eye with glaucoma, severe conjunctivitis, keratitis, or after surgery. Affected people may perceive coloured haloes around bright lights.\\nEdema surrounding the eyes is called periorbital edema (puffy eyes) . The periorbital tissues are most noticeably swollen immediately after waking, perhaps as a result of the gravitational redistribution of fluid in the horizontal position.\\nCommon appearances of cutaneous edema are observed with mosquito bites, spider bites, bee stings (wheal and flare), and skin contact with certain plants such as poison ivy or western poison oak, the latter of which are termed contact dermatitis.\\nAnother cutaneous form of edema is myxedema, which is caused by increased deposition of connective tissue. In myxedema (and a variety of other rarer conditions) edema is caused by an increased tendency of the tissue to hold water within its extracellular space. In myxedema, this is due to  an increase in hydrophilic carbohydrate-rich molecules (perhaps mostly hyaluronin) deposited in the tissue matrix.

It concerns alveolar epithelium, pulmonary capillary endothelium, basement membrane, and perivascular and perilymphatic tissues. It may occur when an injury to the lungs triggers an abnormal healing response. Ordinarily, the body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage, but in interstitial lung disease, the repair process is disrupted, and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. The disease presents itself with the following symptoms: shortness of breath, nonproductive coughing, fatigue, and weight loss, which tend to develop slowly, over several months. The average rate of survival for someone with this disease is between three and five years.

In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.The typical signs and symptoms in children under five are fever, cough, and fast or difficult breathing. Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses and may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe signs and symptoms in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness.Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually result in similar symptoms. Some causes are associated with classic, but non-specific, clinical characteristics. Pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or confusion. Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum. Pneumonia caused by Klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as \"currant jelly\". Bloody sputum (known as hemoptysis) may also occur with tuberculosis, Gram-negative pneumonia, lung abscesses and more commonly acute bronchitis. Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae may occur in association with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, joint pain, or a middle ear infection.

       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(page_content='Negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE), also known as Postobstructive Pulmonary Edema, is a clinical phenomenon that results from the generation of large negative pressures in the airways during attempted inspiration against some form of obstruction of the upper airways. The most common reported cause of NPPE reported in adults is laryngospasm, while the most implicated causes in children are infectious croup and epiglottitis. The large negative pressures created in the airways by inhalation against an upper airway obstruction can lead to fluid being drawn from blood vessels supplying the lungs into the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema and impaired ability for oxygen exchange (hypoxemia). The main treatment for NPPE is supportive care in an intensive care unit and can be fatal without intervention.\\n\\n\\n== Physiology ==\\nNPPE develops as a result of significant negative pressure generated in the chest cavity by inspiration against an upper airway obstruction. These negative pressures in the chest lead to increase venous supply to the right side of the heart (preload) while simultaneously creating more resistance for the left side of the heart to supply blood to the rest of the body (afterload). This large negative force also results in a decrease of the forces exerted by fluids outside of the pulmonary blood vessels. This results in an increased amount of fluid shifting from these vessels into the lower pressure extravascular space. While there normally is a net passage of fluid out of the vasculature at baseline, this is a small enough amount to be drained from the extravascular space by the lymphatic system, and as such fluid does not accumulate. In the setting of NPPE, the excess shift of fluid overcome the ability of the lymphatic system, and fluid (edema) accumulates in the alveoli of the lungs. As these structures are important for gas exchange during respiration, patients with NPPE struggle to have adequate oxygen supply to the tissues of their body.\\n\\n\\n== Causes ==\\nThere are a variety of causes of NPPE, which can theoretically result from any upper airway obstruction. In adults, the most frequent cause is laryngospasm (involuntary contraction of the vocal cords) after extubation, making up approximately 50% of all adults cases of NPPE. The incidence of NPPE as a result of postextubation laryngospasm has been estimated to be between 0.1-3.0%. In the pediatric setting, the reported most common causes of NPPE are both infectious in nature: croup and epiglottitis. Other reported causes include endotracheal tube obstruction (e.g., from patient biting down on tube), tumors/masses compressing the upper airway, choking on foreign objects, strangulation. Interestingly, the use of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular blockade (the mechanism of paralysis during surgery) has also been associated with increased incidence of NPPERisk factors associated with development of NPPE include male sex, younger age, increased cardiovascular fitness, and undergoing head or neck surgery.\\n\\n\\n== Signs and symptoms ==\\nSee signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema\\n\\n\\n== Diagnosis ==\\nDiagnosis of NPPE is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion. When a patient presents with acute pulmonary edema in the perioperative setting, cardiac causes should first be excluded. This can be done with electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, measurement of cardiac enzymes, etc. Other causes of pulmonary edema that require rapid intervention and should be considered first include fluid overload, brain injury, and anaphylaxis. If when considering these differentials, there is no evidence for administration of excessive fluids, no focal signs suggesting a brain injury, and so signs of allergic reaction, one can then consider NPPE. Clinical signs supportive of upper airway obstruction such as stridor and/or wheezing in the setting of pulmonary edema point to the diagnosis of NPPE.\\n\\n\\n== Treatment ==\\nNPPE is potentially fatal, and prompt recognition is important to prevent adverse outcome', metadata={'title': 'Negative-pressure pulmonary edema', 'summary': 'Negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE), also known as Postobstructive Pulmonary Edema, is a clinical phenomenon that results from the generation of large negative pressures in the airways during attempted inspiration against some form of obstruction of the upper airways.
