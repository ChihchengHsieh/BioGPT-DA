It is a term used to distinguish atelectasis identified on imaging based on the underlying pathophysiology to guide diagnosis.\\nClinical presentation\\nThe presentation of patients with atelectasis depends on the underlying cause. However, breathlessness is common if there is significant lung collapse and infective symptoms can be present if there is co-existing sepsis.\\nPathology\\nAs the name implies, in this form of atelectasis there is partial or complete bronchial obstruction which leads to poor ventilation of the airways supplied. As ventilation between the distal airspaces and the trachea is disrupted the residual air in the affected lung is resorbed by the circulating blood at a rate greater than it is replaced by fresh ventilated air. This causes volume loss in the affected lung. Volume loss may be minimal in distal airways obstruction due to the presence of collateral ventilation via the pores of Kohn.\\nThe rate at which atelectasis progresses depends on whether there is obstruction of a lobar or segmental bronchus. Lobar obstruction manifests as lobar atelectasis. In segmental atelectasis, there is often a degree of collateral ventilation from adjacent lung segments which causes a slightly distinct radiographic presentation. The speed of collapse is quicker if the patient is being given 100% oxygen 3.\\nCollapse occurs quickly if the obstruction is due to a luminal lesion that can act as a one-way valve.\\nEventually, there can be sequestration of local lung secretions over time and areas of significant atelectasis are prone to become infected. Hence, this type of collapse is frequently seen with co-existing consolidation.\\nAetiology\\nThe causes of resorption (obstructive) atelectasis can be thought of in terms of where the obstructing lesion is arising from with respect to the bronchial lumen:\\nextraluminal\\nneoplasm\\nlymphadenopathy\\nbronchial\\nfibrotic stricture\\nneoplasm\\nspontaneous rupture 4\\nluminal\\nmucus plugging\\nasthma\\npneumonia\\npostoperative\\npost anaesthetic\\npus\\nbacterial pneumonia\\nblood\\npost-traumatic lung injury\\nforeign body\\nendobronchial intubation\\nRadiographic features\\nPlain radiograph / CT\\nThe imaging features of atelectasis are similar on plain radiographs and CT with more detail being available on the CT:\\nincreased density at the site of atelectasis\\nloss of normal thoracic silhouettes (silhouette sign)\\ndisplacement of the fissures toward the area of atelectasis\\nupward displacement of ipsilateral hemidiaphragm\\ncrowding of pulmonary vessels and bronchi affected area\\ncompensatory hyperinflation of the unaffected lung\\nmediastinal shift\\nipsilateral tracheal deviation\\nipsilateral shift of the heart\\nIf volume loss is minimal and there is consolidation present, then the term drowned lung can be used to indicate transudate replacing the air in the collapsing lung. The transudate is rapidly cleared when the obstruction is removed, as is commonly seen in postoperative patients with mucus plugging.\\nUltrasound\\nAs a consequence of the cessation of ventilation, lung sliding is immediately abolished. In contrast to a pneumothorax, another cause of absent lung sliding, the presence of a lung pulse implies that the visceral and parietal pleura are still in apposition. As alveolar gas is absorbed, the lung parenchyma may assume a tissue-like echogenicity, with the following internal features 9:\\nair bronchograms\\nunlike dynamic air bronchograms (present in e.g. pneumonia) these lentiform, branching echogenicities do not move with respiration 8\\nreferred to as static air bronchograms', metadata={'source': 'https://radiopaedia.org/articles/resorptive-obstructive-atelectasis?lang=gb'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Left lower lobe collapse has distinctive features, and can be readily identified on frontal chest radiographs, provided attention is paid to the normal cardiomediastinal contours. However, the shadow cast by the heart does make it more difficult to see than the right lower lobe collapse.\\nSome of the findings of right lower lobe collapse can be grouped together as they are almost identical on both sides.\\nFor a general discussion please refer to the article on lobar collapse.\\nRadiographic features\\nChest radiograph\\nLeft lower lobe collapse is readily identified on a well-penetrated radiograph of a patient with a normal sized heart but can be challenging in the typical patient with collapse, namely unwell patients, with portable (AP) often underpenetrated films, or with concomitant cardiomegaly. Features include 1-3:\\ntriangular opacity in the posteromedial aspect of the left lung (retrocardiac sail sign)\\nleft lower zone opacification (usually medially) with the apex pointing towards the left hilum\\nedge of the collapsed lung may create a 'double cardiac contour'\\ninferior displacement of the left hilum\\nflat waist sign: flattening of the left heart border\\nobscuration of the left hemidiaphragm\\nobscuration of the descending aorta\\npreservation of a clear left heart border, which is contacted by the lingular segments of the left upper lobe (cf. obscuration seen left upper lobe consolidation)\\ninferior displacement of the oblique fissure\\ndescending interlobar pulmonary artery is not visible\\nNon-specific signs found in left-sided atelectasis are usually also present including:\\nelevation of the left hemidiaphragm\\ncrowding of the left ribs\\nshift of the mediastinum to the left\\nOn the lateral projection the findings are usually obvious:\\ntriangular opacification in the lower posterior chest\\nleft hemidiaphragm is obscured posteriorly and the lower thoracic vertebrae appear denser than normal (they are usually more radiolucent than the upper vertebrae) 3\\noblique fissure displaced posteroinferiorly but may be invisible with a severe collapse of the left lower lobe as it fissure rotates posteromedially becoming non-tangential to the x-ray beam 2\\ninferior displacement of the left hilum\\nCT\\ntriangular opacification in axial images, thinner at the hilum, against the posterior mediastinum and medial hemidiaphragm 2\\noblique fissure rotates posteromedially or posteriorly 2\\ncompensatory hyperinflation of the left upper lobe 2\\nDifferential diagnosis\\nThe characteristic shape associated with volume loss usually does not allow for any significant differential diagnosis.
